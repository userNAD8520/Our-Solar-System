            <p>
              The Sun holds the solar system together, keeping everything from
              the biggest planets to the smallest debris in its orbit. Our Sun
              is a 4.5 billion-year-old star a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and
              helium at the center of our solar system. The Sun is about 93
              million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, and without its
              energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home
              planet. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma,heated to
              incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The Sun
              radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared
              radiation, The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000
              miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000
              times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of
              the Solar System

              Earth—our home planet—is the only place we know of so far that’s
              inhabited by living things. It's also the only planet in our solar
              system with liquid water on the surface , Our home planet is the
              third planet from the Sun. While Earth is only the fifth largest
              planet in the solar system, Just slightly larger than nearby
              Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the
              Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. Earth has a dynamic
              atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects
              it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a
              composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is
              widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most

            <p>
              Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus's thick atmosphere
              traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest
              planet in our solar system. Venus is the second planet from the
              Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the
              four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called
              Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. These are
              not identical twins, however there are radical differences between
              the two worlds. Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with
              carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish
              clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway
              greenhouse effect.even though Mercury is closer to the Sun Surface
              temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475
              degrees Celsius) hot enough to melt lead.

            <h1>MARS</h1>
            <p>
              Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The reddish color of its
              surface is due to finely grained iron (III)oxide dust in the soil,
              giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". Mars has a second
              smallest radius among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5
              km (2,106 mi) and has a surface gravity of 3.72 m/s2 (12.2 ft/s2),
              which is 38% of Earth's gravity. The Martian dichotomy can be
              clearly seen on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars
              northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than Mars southern
              hemisphere. Mars has a very thin atmosphere made primarily of
              carbon dioxide and two irregularly shaped natural satellites:
              Phobos and Deimos.

              Jupiter is more than twice as massive than the other planets of
              our solar system combined. The giant planet' s Great Red Spot is a
              centuries-old storm bigger than Earth. upiter has a long history
              of surprising scientists all the way back to 1610 when Galileo
              Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed
              the way we see the universe. Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter
              is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system . Jupiter's
              familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of
              ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and
              helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger

            <h1>URANUS</h1>
            <p>
              Uranus—seventh planet from the Sun—rotates at a nearly 90-degree
              angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus
              appear to spin on its side. and has the third-largest diameter in
              our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a
              telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William
              Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or
              a star. it was two years later that the object was universally
              accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by
              astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to
              name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead,
              the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it
              Uranus, the Greek god of the sky as suggested by Bode.​

              Neptune—the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our
              Sun—is dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds. It was the
              first planet located through mathematical calculations. Dark,
              cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, More than 30 times as far
              from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar
              system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by
              mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its
              first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846. NASA's Voyager 2
              is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. the
              third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17
              times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its
              near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than
              Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational
              compression of its atmosphere.
